## Inspiration
As seniors in high school, we wanted to create a budgeting tool that we would want to use! When we go to college next year, we’ll have to manage our budgets, and this tool is perfect for that!

## What it does
Our website allows you to set up an account, input expenses, and see a visualization of your data.

## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and integrated Google Charts API, Google Maps API, and Capital One’s Hackathon API to pull information from a database, graph it, and show nearby banks.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating Capital One’s Hackathon API was challenging since we had to work with JavaScript Promises for the first time. Pulling the data, showing it, and plotting it all within a span of 20 hours was difficult, but we persevered.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of how our website works, it is aesthetically pleasing and on-theme, and also easy to use!

## What we learned
We learned how to integrate different APIs, but also learned how to collaborate as a team. Working on a website from 4 different computers brought it’s own challenges, but we learned to figure out what worked best for us.

## What's next for BudgetBusters
There is so much more for us to work on! We’d like to further expand our sign-up options and provide more analysis and budgeting advice.
